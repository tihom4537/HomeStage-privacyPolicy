'''We at HomeStage are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, 
  use, and protect your personal information when you use our app. By using our services, you agree to the terms outlined below.

  1. Information We Collect
  - **Location Data**: We collect your location and the artist's location to provide tailored search results. This data is collected **only while the app is in use**, not in the background. You can opt-out of location services by adjusting your device settings, but this may limit some functionality.
  - **Contact Information**: We collect phone numbers of both users and artists to facilitate bookings. User phone numbers will not be shared with third parties, except for communication between users and artists. Artist phone numbers will be shared with users to complete the booking process. 
  - **Payment Information**: We collect payment details (e.g., bank account information) to send payments for services rendered. **We do not store credit card or payment gateway details** on our servers. All transactions are processed securely via third-party payment gateways that comply with **Indian and Apple App Store privacy regulations**.
  - **Other Information**: We may collect device information, usage data, and interaction data to improve our services. You can choose to limit this data collection in your device settings.

  2. Use of Third-Party Services
  - We use third-party payment gateways to process payments. These services comply with **Indian laws and Apple App Store guidelines**, and we ensure your payment information is handled securely. However, we are not responsible for any issues arising from their services. Additionally, we may use analytics tools to help us understand how users interact with the app.
  - **Sharing with Third-Parties**: We may share data with third-party service providers solely for the purposes of improving the app's functionality (e.g., for payments, analytics). No personal data will be sold or shared with advertisers without your explicit consent.

  3. Data Security
  - We take the security of your personal data seriously and use encryption, secure servers, and other safeguards to protect it from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.
  - **User Control**: You have the right to request access to the data we collect, request its deletion, or limit data processing by contacting us at [Insert Contact Email]. We will promptly comply with requests as required by **Apple's privacy policies**.

  4. Changes to This Policy
  - We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You will be notified of any significant changes through the app or via email, and your continued use of the app signifies your acceptance of the updated terms. You may always review the most recent version in the app.

  5. Children's Privacy
  - Our services are not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected data from a child under 13 without proper parental consent, we will take steps to delete it immediately.

  6. Contact Us
  - If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your personal data, please contact us at [Insert Contact Email].
