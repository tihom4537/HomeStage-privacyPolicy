'''We at HomeStage are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, 
use, and protect your personal information when you use our app. By using our services, you agree to the terms outlined below.

1. Information We Collect
- Location Data: We collect your location and the artist's location to provide tailored search results. This data is collected only while the app is in use, not in the background.
- Contact Information: We collect the phone numbers of both users and artists to facilitate bookings. User phone numbers will not be shared with third parties, except for facilitating communication between users and artists. Artist phone numbers will be shared with users to complete the booking process, and vice versa.
- Payment Information: For artists, we collect payment details (e.g., bank account information) to send payments for services rendered. HomeStage does not store credit card or payment gateway details on our servers.

2. Use of Third-Party Services
- We use third-party payment gateways to process payments. These services comply with Indian laws, and we ensure that your payment information is handled securely. However, we are not responsible for any issues arising from their service.

3. Data Security
- We take the security of your personal data seriously and use appropriate measures to protect it from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.

4. Changes to This Policy
- We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You will be notified of any significant changes, and your continued use of the app signifies your acceptance of the updated terms.
